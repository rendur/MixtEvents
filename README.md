# Mixt Wallet
Empowering artist and there supporters

The idea of this project is to have a wallet that has everything you need to attend our events and help onboard our supporters and artists into the blockchain world. It will be completely open sourced and built on the XRPL.

Wallet Tab- This tab will be used to hold tokens. We will utilize the DEX on the XRPL so that people have the choice of what they would like to hold and they can easily convert when attending our events or any other event in the crypto space.
Our token will be a reward token that we will be supplying to our supporters when they buy tickets, merch etc. Supporters will also be capable of redeeming reward tokens for tickets, merchandise and whatever our marketing team comes up with.

Event ticket tab- This will be where our smart contract event tickets will help. Please read Guts white label attach. Their get protocol is an open source project that we would love to use for our events or make something similar. But our main goal with this is to avoid middlemen, scalping and high ticket fees.

NFT Tab. This section will be used for people to show off and display their tokens. You can display XRPL NFTS and ERC NFTS.

NFT MarketPlace - This Is where our supporters can Buy/Sell/Trade and mint NFTS on the XRPL. Our idea for NFTS is to make them rare and specific to events and artists. Weâ€™ll program NFTS to give discounts on our tickets and merchandise. The idea behind the market place is so that at our events people can freely Trade NFTS at a low cost on the XRPL.

We want to make this app super integratabtle to any wallet and extremely user friendly.
